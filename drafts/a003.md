Dear JH:

Many phenomena in nature are derived from positive feedback. Nearly all of these present radical problems for explication, control and other methods of understanding. I always found this interesting because our understanding is a creature of positive feedback in and of itself. You are presented two problems, and only given that they are strictly in the disciplines of physics and of sociology. Which one, given only that information, would you despair of humankind's ability to answer?

The black swan can be attacked by the creation of an ansatz and doing matching. By a black swan I mean a power law net, but it should also be possible to coerce other things into that form.

An ansatz is a physics term for the guess of the form of how an solution to a problem will exist. By matching I mean a percolation graph matching.

The ansatz can be created by the method of the stochastic kronecker graph, which is a fractal method to create fat tailed power law networks. The matching can be a percolation graph matching.

Here is evidence for why the matching works, given that I do have a working thing.

The reason why this is interesting is that there is often few ways to attack the black swan.

The reason why this works is synchronizability.
