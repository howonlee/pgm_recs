The basic idea behind PGM is that you have a partial matching, and you enlarge the matching one match by one match in each iterative step. The way you choose which possible match you add to the matchings you already have is by a sort of induction.

You already have your seed mapping as of now.

===pic of seed mapping

Those seed mappings should extend marks which mark each possible neighbor matching, saying that this one should be better or this one should be better:

===pic of seed mapping + matching, some seeds have now been "used"

At any point, if you get above a threshhold of marks for a possible matching, you can now say that the possible matching is a real one.

=== pic of new matching

In working Python code:

```
import collections
import random
import itertools
import networkx as nx

def normal_pgm(net1, net2, seeds, r):
    """
    net1 and net2 are networkx networks
    seeds is a list of correct seed matchings
    r is how many marks you need to say that a matching is good
    Gets about 1200 matches on 2048 SKG, selected 90%
    """
    marks = collections.defaultdict(int)
    impossible_tails, impossible_heads = set(), set()
    unused, used = seeds[:], []
    random.shuffle(unused) # mutation!
    while unused:
        curr_pair = unused.pop()
        prod_len = len(net1.neighbors(curr_pair[0])) * len(net2.neighbors(curr_pair[0]))
        for neighbor in itertools.product(net1.neighbors(curr_pair[0]), net2.neighbors(curr_pair[1])):
            if neighbor[0] in impossible_heads or neighbor[1] in impossible_tails:
                continue
            marks[neighbor] += 1
            if marks[neighbor] > r:
                unused.append(neighbor)
                impossible_heads.add(neighbor[0])
                impossible_tails.add(neighbor[1])
                continue
        used.append(curr_pair)
    return used
```

There are a few variants which exist, of which I used one which separates the matching itself and the possibility of spreading the marks: see the repository for details.

The "percolation" referred to in the percolation matching indicates the percolation of marks throughout the mapping and the way that the mapping expands one by one. This also is the main cause of why the algorithm is of interest to me, because it is why the algorithm creates long-distance influence in the matchings.
