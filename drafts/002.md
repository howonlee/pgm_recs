The black swan can be attacked by the creation of an ansatz and doing matching. By a black swan I mean a power law net, but it should also be possible to coerce other things into that form.

The ansatz can be done by SKG and the matching can be a PGM.

The reason why this is interesting is that there is often few ways to attack the black swan.

The reason why this works is synchronizability, I think.
