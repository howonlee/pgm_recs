The black swan can be attacked by the creation of an ansatz and doing matching. By a black swan I mean a power law net, but it should also be possible to coerce other things into that form.

An ansatz is a physics term for the guess of the form of how an solution to a problem will exist. By matching I mean a percolation graph matching.

The ansatz can be created by the method of the stochastic kronecker graph, which is a fractal method to create fat tailed power law networks. The matching can be a percolation graph matching.

Here is evidence for why the matching works, given that I do have a working thing.

The reason why this is interesting is that there is often few ways to attack the black swan.

The reason why this works is synchronizability.
