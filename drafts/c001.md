Dear JH:

Consider a human social network. It has strange properties.

The reason why it has such properties is because of the underlying generative process that creates them.

Actually, this is very close to a well-disseminated idea by NN Taleb, but he would say by BB Mandelbrot, which is that of the Black Swan. This is because of the distributional structure of the world which he advocates. The human social network is actually of a black swan nature.

One way to attack human social networks is by percolation graph matching.

Tutorial on percolation graph matching.

The Black Swan can be attacked by percolation graph matching and the creation of an ansatz.
